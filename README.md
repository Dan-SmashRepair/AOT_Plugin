# AOT_Plugin
BakkesMod Aerial Orientation Trainer

Controlling rocket cars in 3D is hard.  
Use this plugin to train your muscle memory so you can rotatate your car quickly from any position to any other.

The goal is to align the front of your car with the yellow arrow and the bottom of your car with the orange arrow as fast as you can.

Once you get the hang of the default settings, try setting the round time limit to 2s.  
As you get better, you can try gradually changing the accuracy difficulty.  
Believe it or not, it is possible to get from any random starting orientation to any random target orientation in less than 1s!
